# The Prob(F) reflects a low liklihood that all variables are 0
# R^2 of 96.4% and R of 97.5% reflect that the variables account for a large amount of the change in S&P 500
#   as well as that there is a strong correlation between the model and S&P 500
# Additional modification can be completed to convert variables to categorical variables and conduct logistic regression
# Important notes: The above process was intended to go through some basic processes and is not intended to represent an accurate model
